# SONA 2025 In the Eyes of A Young Filipino Student

### Brief History
The State of the Nation Address (SONA) is held every year to highlight the accomplishments of the current administration the past year. It started with President Manuel Quezon, who gave the first SONA under the Commonwealth administration on **November 25, 1935.** 

Ever since then, it has become an annual tradition. Its only gaps during the Second World War and 1986, in which the 20-year dictatorship of Former President Ferdinand Marcos was put to an end. 

The Martial Law saw its first few SONA related protests, with the first one done in **1970** which marked the series of protests against the administration, which we now know as the First Quarter Storm.

Now, however, dismayed countrymen protest---or simply burn effigies---everytime SONA is conducted. The program and its presidents tend to receive a lot of criticism and uproar from the people, of course, *for a reason*.

### "That's Interesting!"
#### 1. Acknowledgement
> **Bigo at dismayado ang mga tao sa pamahalaan**, lalo na sa mga pangunahing serbisyo. Ang leksyon sa atin ay simple lamang: kailangan pa natin mas lalong galingan. *Kailangan pa natin mas lalong bilisan.*

This was a good start; with this, the President acknowledged that the people were not content. The people needed *more*. The government was barely able to give the masses what they truly needed, and this reflection shows that, at the very least, they acknowledge this need and dismay. 

#### 2. Education Reforms
First of all, I would like to commend the President for acknowledging the lack of facilities and, of course, acknowledging the hard work teachers do for us students. I appreciate the development our country is experiencing in this aspect, especially as our country is, admittedly, lacking in this aspect. According to PSA, only around 70.8% of people are functionally literate; while the Philippines has a 97% literacy late, this means that an astounding percentage of people are *functionally illiterate.* The Philippines needs more improvement.

#### 3. PhilHealth Medical Expense Coverage
It seems that we are getting closer and closer to an excellent healthcare system; one can even say that the dream of a free healthcare system in our country is tangible (though we still have a long way to go). The notion of accessible healthcare should be pushed more, and I am glad to see some improvements regarding this aspect.  

* I would also like to add the fact that the government is seeking to improve the accessibility of electricity and water in the province of Siquijor, who is prone to typhoons and flooding. This aims to help the wellbeing and overall quality of living of our fellow filipinos.

### "Ha...?"

> â€œSa mga nakikipagsabwatan upang kunin ang pondo ng bayan at nakawin ang kinabukasan ng ating mga mamamayan, ***mahiya naman kayo sa inyong kapwa Pilipino***. Mahiya naman kayo sa mga kabahayan nating naanod o nalubog sa pagbaha. Mahiya naman kayo lalo na sa mga anak natin na magmamana ng utang nung ibinulsa niyo ang pera,"
* This, to me, seems quite hypocritical. The Marcos Family is known for their tendency to keep money from taxpayers to themselves, especially proving true when we trace back PBBM's family; his father being none other than *Ferdinand Marcos Sr.*, an official known to have dug the hole deep for his own country. It comes off as contradictory. 

Also, the last two points in the segment where I put the topics that interested me are part of the things that I got weirded out in too. The goals and programs in mind seem too *optimistic.* This begs the question---***kaya nga ba ito ng ating bansang nahihirap***?


### SONA 2025: Maaari nga ba?
The SONA 2025 is full of *optimism*, I must admit, pero that's the thing---SONA is usually filled with optimism naman talaga. It is a program that serves to deliver the accomplishments and achievements of the past year to the nation---it is also an action to prompt the nation to put their trust in them. This is very prominent in the SONA this year. A lot of programs and campaigns have been promised, this being the most prominent in the sectors of health and education. I have one question that I share with the Filipino People: ***Matutupad nga ba?***

Even after all of this, I believe that there have been significant improvements in our country, and I hope that our country continues growing like this. The Philippines is a relatively young country, but in its history, its prone to danger and colonial influences, and sometimes, it is the filipino people that turn against their nation. I sincerely hope that the Filipino develops into a country that is not marred by political dynasties and controversies.

I have hope for this country, and I hope the government strengthens that hope.

### *Sana.*
Sana nga matupad.
