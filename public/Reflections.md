## End of Quarter Reflections

To be frank, I expected that my performance in class would be poorer than what I currently am right now. While I flunked my summative assessments, I believe that I improved in many different ways; I understood the topics well enough for me to get through, but I acknowledge the need to improve. (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)

### 5 topics in class that I know very well! 
**1. Arithmetic & Logical Operators**: this topic is one of the very first topics and the most basic. It is essential to understand and master this because it is essentially the core of logical statements. It is similar to math---arithmetic is the foundation. This was also discussed in C++ so the jump was not that drastic.

**2. Generating output**: this is one of the new topics that I encountered in JS. Though, it is relatively easy to understand and remember. We learned the uses of console.log(), alert, and document.write. We also differentiated them; for example, **console.log()** is best for **debugging** because the output does not print in the browser, but rather you can see it in the console tab; for **alert**, it is used as pop-up **notifications**, and for **document.write()**, it is best when your information needs to be overwritten and for **testing**. From hereon, our practices would center around these three.

**3. If-else and Switch Control Statements**: This was a very easy topic to get because we already used this in C++. In fact, we used this all the time. It is also pretty straightforward, and is best used in conditions that are rather short; this is one of the things that I easily mastered.

**4. Loops**: This is also one of the things that I easily mastered and understood the use of! I remember being very confused about this topic in C++, but now I get it. As of now, we have only talked about three kinds of loops: **while, do while, and for.** Once you get the topic and once you understand the differences, it will become easier to understand. 

**5. Variable declaration**: Also one of the very first topics in JS and, again, the most fundamental to know. At first, I expected it to be extremely similar to C++ as you had to declare each of the variables data types (int, string, etc); but JS is loosely typed, and I found that fascinating. We learned the different data types and how to differentiate and use them. 

### 5 topics I can improve my understanding on
**1. Ternary operators**: I can understand ternary operators, however, I think we need more exercises that will truly allow us to master the topic. I think the main thing about this is that we need to learn how to **apply** it, not just **identify** it.

**2. Functions (especially function outputs)**: This is definitely just a me issue, but I think we also need more guided practice on this---especially determining the return values and whatnot. Yes, it depends on the code and the style of the coder, but it would benefit everyone to have more practice exercise on this!

**3. Inserting output**: This is similar to the ones above, but we need more practice to see how it works. As of now, I have a hard time appreciating it since I do not see the use. However, I think ma'am mentioned that we will use this a lot during second quarter, so we'll see! I'm excited to learn how to use it.

**4. Data Comparison**: Practice is the approach to truly learn Computer Science, however, in this topic, we did not have many opportunities to use and appreciate it. I can identify what the output is if asked, yes, but I have not really used it in exercises yet. I want to see different approaches to one problem using data comparison!

**5. Button Functions**: The week of discussing this along with input and output functions was, unfortunately, very fast-paced for me and I did not know how to keep up. I have not had the opportunity to appreciate this truly yet, and I felt like the knowledge I gained from this was put away. More application for sure!

### Plans of action
As I mentioned, CS is very heavily **practice-based**. You can only learn to code if you practice more, and improve your **logic**!! That's the problem with me! My logic **heavily needs help**! (ó﹏ò｡) I feel as though I am always behind when it comes to *actually* interpreting problems and transferring them into code. I can't even get basic problems right.

What I've been doing is practice---sometimes, I take from the internet, sometimes, I use AI to generate practice problems suited for me and my level. However, I've been inconsistent. I definitely need to practice more. 

Other than that, I should designate periods of time and devote it to CS. Similar to the other statement, maybe 1 problem every other day will help me better than practicing everything the day before the assessment.

That should be all! I'm looking forward to improve! ٩(^ᗜ^ )و ´-

### Activities that are effective and not effective
#### Effective:
**1. Graded Exercise 7**: I think this exercise, while tedious, truly helped me understand how functions work. It gave me the opportunity to practice my return statements, and I also figured out how to detect if a user-inputted value is NaN!

**2. Graded Exercise 6**: very effective! allowed me to approach the problem with a solution that I feel would define my coding style. It was not so straightforward, but I remember being so proud of myself because I understood the logic the moment I read the problem. That is what I aim to do in all my assessments from hereon, and identify patterns as well. 

#### Ineffective:
**1. Graded Exercise 7**: In the sense that it was very difficult to code trace and identify the errors in the code---especially in determining which is wrong and which is correct. It took me a really long time and many, many frustrated sighs to get it right. 
**2. Graded Exercise 4: Hola!**: It was not as effective as I believe that switch statements were easier to master; I did not have to use my brain that much as it required minimal effort and was very straightforward.
